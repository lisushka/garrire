`~roll` (aliases: `~dice`, `~die`)
**Roll some dice by tabletop notation (e.g. `3d20`)**
Notation is `[N]d[M]`, where `[N]` is the number of rolls to make with an `[M]`-sided die. `[N]` is optional and defaults to 1. You can roll multiple dice at once, e.g. `1d20 2d10 3d5`. Sides don't have to make physical sense: a `d2` is possible, as is a `d1`, as is a `d1927362`.
